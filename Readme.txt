# SA_Java_Journals
Project to apply to Java Software Architect Crossover's position

ASSUMTIONS:
-A journal has many publications
-for simplicity, the files are stored BLOB.(better is to store in file sistem)
-JEE stack used instead Spring, why? to me JEE requires less configuration and has less dependencies (because we are using an app server). Althoug Spring is more portable
-for simplicity, Payara Application server used
